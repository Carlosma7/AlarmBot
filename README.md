## Description

**AlarmBot** comes up as a personal project that aspires to define an useful and simple Telegram Bot to manage a home alarm system. It just defines the registration system and the API to notify users via Telegram, not the alarm trigger.

For that purpose, it will use the [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) library to define a Telegram Bot, together with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as the framework for the API that triggers notifications, together with [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) as ASGI web server.

## User manual

**AlarmBot** is a simple system whose deployment just depends on a **.env** file that contains a **Token** from Telegram Bot (if you don't know how to obtain one, follow this [official tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)).

Now, the available commands to work with AlarmBot are listed:

**Execute AlarmBot**
Starts a Telegram Bot and defines a FastAPI API with Uvicorn.

```shell
invoke execute
```

**Stop AlarmBot**
Stops the execution by killing the related processes.

```shell
invoke stop
```

**Clean AlarmBot**
Cleans the python cach√© and log files from both APIs.

```shell
invoke clean
```
 	
## Install

To install all dependencies you just need to execute the following:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
